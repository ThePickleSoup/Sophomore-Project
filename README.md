The following documents are an assortment of files found or created for my Sophomore Project course.
We are working on designing a PV-Integrated Energy Source.
My role is the group is Designer. My tasks are to create the code and CAD deisgns for the project.
> blah blah blah, insert something about what that is. look it up idk.

The current Arduino code that is being employed is titled: MTC_V3, and is on version 0.3.0.

Tasks for code:
