The following documents are an assortment of files found or created for my Sophomore Project course. 
We are working on designing a PV-Battery Integrated Energy Source. 
My role in the group is Designer. 
My tasks are to create the code and CAD deisgns for the project.

As Designer, I have included the two reports required by the course to turn in for a grade. Reading them is not necessary.
